    In Mumbai, A mastermind steals ₹2,000 crore (US$260 million) with ease. Since he used random, unrelated people to rob the money who were unaware of their assistance in the robbery, it was proved near impossible to identify the culprit. A nationwide search ensues to find the culprit, Ashok Chakravarthy, a covert operative is assigned to head of the search. Working with crime branch officer Amritha Nair, they uncover a thief named Jai. Ashok meets Jai in a bar and the latter reveals about the information on the black box – the key to the locker holding ₹2,000 crore (US$260 million) of all the board members of Roy's group located in Waaji City. Kalki, on Vishwank's command, travels to Mumbai and retrieves the black box and deposits it in a bank. During these incidents, Amritha and Ashok fall in love.
